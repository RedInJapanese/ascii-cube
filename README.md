# ascii cube
 My implementation of the spinning ASCII cube in C

## Terminology
**Euclidean Space**: refers to the fundamental space of geometry used to represent physical space
**Transformation Matrices**: 
## Rotation Matrix


### Euclidean Space
This basicaly refers to the fundamental space of geometry used to represent physical space

## Things I Need to Learn/Implement Next Time: 
    - understand how rotation matrices work 
    - find the cross product of the rotation matrices
    - implement it procedurally
