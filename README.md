# ascii cube
 My implementation of the spinning ASCII cube in C

## Terminology
**Euclidean Space** : refers to the fundamental space of geometry used to represent physical space
**Linear Transformation**: the idea of taking in given number(s) as input and outputting number(s). In some cases, these can be vectors as well
#### The two properties of linear transformations:
   - All lines have to be lines and not have curvature
   - The origins of a given vector has to remain fixed
**Basis Vectors**: 
**Vector Space**:
## Rotation Matrix


### Euclidean Space
This basicaly refers to the fundamental space of geometry used to represent physical space

## Things I Need to Learn/Implement Next Time: 
    - understand how rotation matrices work 
    - find the cross product of the rotation matrices
    - implement it procedurally
